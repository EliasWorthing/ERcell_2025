abstract = {Modeling and simulation are effective tools for understanding the electrochemical processes in pyroprocessing as well as for predicting some fundamental data of actinides and fission products in molten salt. The present study first reviewed the available models, and then identified the potential mechanisms that influence the electrochemical processes and how to simplify and model the mechanisms for different operation conditions as well as how to integrate all the mechanisms. The study also discussed how to use models to predict some fundamental data such as material solubility, diffusion coefficient and activity coefficient. Some directions were suggested finally to improve the accuracy and robustness of the current models.}

A variety of phenomena occurring in electrochemical devices is reviewed along with examination of existing computer models to provide basis for new model development. Key processes and phenomena of importance were selected based on describing rate-limiting steps and separation efficiency of electrorefining. The developed model, named ERAD, describes time-dependent behavior of multi-component electrochemical systems with the capability of depicting anodic dissolution of spent nuclear fuel, non-hydrodynamic mass transport effects in the electrolyte, and cathodic deposition of materials. Utilization of the model is demonstrated through comparison with existing experimental data. For the purpose of model validation, model predictions are also compared with cyclic voltammetry and other experimental data.}

abstract = {A simulation code for the molten salt electrorefining of spent metallic nuclear fuel from the Integral Fast Reactor has been developed. This code (named trail) employs diffusion layer theory in the vicinity of the electrodes. Model parameters such as the diffusion layer thickness were determined from polarization data measured with uranium at different concentrations in the molten salt electrolyte and liquid cadmium anode of an electrorefining cell. Calculations were made to verify the code with experimental data for various operational modes. Good agreement with the data was obtained. It was also found that this code can provide useful information to aid in understanding the electrotransport process within the electrorefiner.}

ABSTRACT = {A transient three-dimensional comprehensive numerical model was established to study ion transport caused by diffusion, convection, and electro-migration in the electro-refining process for scrap-metal recycling. The Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations were used to define ion transport within the electrolyte, while the Naiver–Stokes equations and the energy equation were employed to describe fluid flow and heat transfer. In addition, the Butler-Volmer formulation was used to represent the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction. The comparison between the measured and simulated data indicates the reliability of the model. Under the action of diffusion and electro-migration, the positive copper ion moves from the anode to the cathode, while the negative sulfate ion migrates in the opposite direction. The distribution of the ion concentration, however, greatly changes if the fluid flow is taken into account. The ion concentration around the anode and the rate of the electrochemical reaction that occurs at the anode surface are reduced by the fluid flow. The proposed computational framework offers a valuable basis for future research and development in the field of scrap-metal recycling technology.},

journal = {Journal of The Electrochemical Society},
abstract = {Electrorefining is an important unit operation for the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuel; however, the uncontrolled growth of uranium dendrites traps molten salt into the deposited uranium, increases the short-circuit risk, decreases the current efficiency, and thus hinders the engineering application of the electrorefining technology. In this study, the finite element method is applied to the study of the electrorefining dynamics subjected to convection, diffusion, electromigration, and electrode reaction. The velocity field, concentration field, electric field, and flux density field are evaluated. The local current density on the cathode is evaluated under different overall current densities, overpotentials, cathodic shapes and positions for the evaluation of dendritic growth. Finally, it is concluded that the uranium will be deposited priorly onto the cathode tip and the frontside of the cathode facing the anode, the position of the electrode and the shape of the cathode tip will not have significant influence to the priority of deposition, and a glass insulated tip can effectively improve the uneven growth of uranium dendrites on the cathode surface as proposed by Srihari et al.

title = {Multi-Species Hydrodynamic Electrochemical Modeling with Liquid Metal and Rotating Cylinder Electrodes in Molten Salt},
journal = {Journal of The Electrochemical Society},
abstract = {The accurate prediction of a hydrodynamic electrochemical system with radioactive materials can reduce the economic costs and radiological risk of repeated experiments. Such a prediction requires the computationally rich coupling of hydrodynamic phenomena and electrochemical reactions at a multi-dimensional domain, especially for multiple species in heterogeneous phases. This study develops a finite element method model to simulate the transport phenomena and electrochemical reactions of U, Pu, and Nd simultaneously in a molten salt metallurgical electrorefining system. The results are validated against lab-scale experimental data conducted in high temperature LiCl-KCl molten salt. The experiment conducted in the Argonne National Laboratory has a unique electrochemical cell with a combination of liquid metal and rotating solid cylinder electrodes. The model successfully simulates the time-dependent multi-species behaviors of the system such as dissolution rates from the liquid metal anode and deposit composition on the rotating cylinder electrode. In particular, it successfully predicts the transition time of depositing element at the cathode from U to Pu, which is very important information for product quality and process monitoring. In addition, it can catch the change of thermodynamic behaviors of Pu by forming intermetallic compounds with liquid Cd metal.}

abstract = {This study presents three-dimensional simulation results of multispecies and multi-reaction electrorefining for spent nuclear waste treatment. Fluid-dynamic behavior of electrorefining is analyzed by commercial computational fluid-dynamics code. The results of local fluid dynamics are coupled with one-dimensional electrochemical reaction analysis code in order to predict local current density distribution. The new approach shows current distribution patterns over the cathode surface in LiCl–KCl molten-salt electrolyte. The current density distribution patterns are analyzed for various electrode rotational speeds and diverse applied currents and the results show a good agreement with general principle of mass transfer observations. Spatially periodic and vertically striped pattern of current density is predicted at the cathode side due to mass transfer depression at separation points. These slow mass transfer regions are vulnerable to be contaminated by transuranic elements. High rotational cathode speed and slow rotational anode speed are favorable to achieve uniform current density distribution with high applied current. The developed three-dimensional simulation will provide an improved understanding of complex electrochemical and transport phenomena that cannot be experimentally investigated and can be used to improve efficiency of electrorefiner design with high uranium throughput and small effluence of radioactive transuranic elements.}

ABSTRACT = {Like most additive manufacturing processes for metals, material jetting processes require support structures in order to attain full 3D capability. The support structures have to be removed in subsequent operations, which increases costs and slows down the manufacturing process. One approach to this issue is the use of water-soluble support structures made from salts that allow a fast and economic support removal. In this paper, we analyze the influence of salt support structures on material jetted aluminum parts. The salt is applied in its molten state, and because molten salts are typically corrosive substances, it is important to investigate the interaction between support and build material. Other characteristic properties of salts are high melting temperatures and low thermal conductivity, which could potentially lead to remelting of already printed structures and might influence the microstructure of aluminum that is printed on top of the salt due to low cooling rates. Three different sample geometries have been examined using optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-hardness testing. The results indicate that there is no distinct influence on the process with respect to remelting, micro-hardness and chemical reactions. However, a larger dendrite arm spacing is observed in aluminum that is printed on salt.},

A developing mass transfer boundary layer was considered and the governing equation was solved using an integral method. Variation of viscosity in the mass transfer boundary layer was included as proposed by Aimar and Field (1992) [29]. Polyvinyl alcohol, having molecular weight of 14,000, was used as the gel forming material. A weak dependence of mass transfer coefficient on transmembrane pressure drop was observed. The final expression of Sherwood number was obtained using 50% of the experimental data of the steady state. Permeate flux values were calculated for the rest 50% of the experiments using the developed relation in the predictive mode. In all cases, the predictions lie within ±10% of the experimental data.

The second model examines the physical behaviour of a multi-species electrochemical system with multiple excess inert ionic species and only one reacting species. Finite difference schemes with both second-order temporal and spatial accuracy are proposed to solve the two models. Unlike conventional algorithms in the literature, the present solution procedures decouple the concentrations and electric potential calculations. The modelling of reaction kinetics at the electrodes requires special treatment of numerical boundary conditions.}
